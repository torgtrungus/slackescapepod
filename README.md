# slackescapepod
##Downloads all posts, video, and image content from Slack, builds a browsable, local copy of the server




I had planned to release this eventually but as Slack recently (6/25/24) announced they are going to delete content older than 90 days maybe you don't want your content held hostage.

You will need admin access to the server to get all the JSONs and to get a token to use to download all the custom emojis.


good luck

Notes:

This project has incomplete features but should get 95% of everything right - at least as far as my server was set up. For mystery reasons it may not work for you. If so, try to figure it out. I will not help you - this is basically software you found on the sidewalk and took home. Treat it as such.
